# Pneumonia_detection
This project uses the Chest X-Ray dataset available on the Kaggle. The dataset contains the chest x-ray images of people who are healthy and people who are suffering from pneumonia. The goal is to classify the images based in these two classes. A deep convolutional neural network model is built and trained on this dataset. The accuracy achieved by this model is around 86%.
